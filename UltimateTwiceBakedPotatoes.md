Ultimate twice baked potatoes

- 4 large baking potatoes
- 8 slices bacon
- 2.4dl sour cream
- 1.2dl milk
- 4 tablespoons butter
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon pepper
- 2.4dl cup shredded "präst ost" or any other flavorrish cheese
- 8 green onions, sliced, divided

Method
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Bake potatoes in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until they're done.
- Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.
- When potatoes are done allow them to cool for 10 minutes. Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop the flesh into a large bowl; save skins. To the potato flesh add sour cream, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup cheese and 1/2 the green onions. Mix with a hand mixer until well blended and creamy. Spoon the mixture into the potato skins. Top each with remaining cheese, green onions and bacon.
- Bake for another 15 minutes.
